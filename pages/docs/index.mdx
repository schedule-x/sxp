# Getting started

Schedule-X Premium currently offers two packages, and a third is in the making:

import FeaturesList from "../../components/partials/features-list/features-list";

<FeaturesList features={[
    "Interactive Event Modal",
    "Sidebar",
    "Gantt chart view (planned release Q4 of 2024)",
]} />
