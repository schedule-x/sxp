# Getting started

Schedule-X Premium currently offers three packages, and a fourth is in the making:

import FeaturesList from "../../components/partials/features-list/features-list";

<FeaturesList features={[
    "Interactive Event Modal",
    "Sidebar",
    "Drag to create",
    "Resource view (beta release planned for Q3 of 2024)",
]} />
